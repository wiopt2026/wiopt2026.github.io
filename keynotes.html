      This talk will present an overview of recent work in the Open6G center laying the basic architectural and algorithmic principles for new approaches to designing open, programmable, AI-powered, and virtualized next-generation cellular networks. We will discuss a forward-looking agenda aimed at developing programmable testbeds enabling 6G research in networked intelligence. We will then cover research challenges and recent progress in architectural design, intelligence orchestration, conflict avoidance, and explainability.

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> We consider the problem of network utility maximization (NUM) and propose a new Learning-NUM framework, where the users’ utility functions are unknown apriori and the utility function values can be observed only after the corresponding traffic is delivered to the destination. We start by considering linear utility functions and propose a priority-based network control policy, that combines techniques from network control and multi-arm bandits to achieve logarithmic regret. We then consider the case of concave utility functions and design the Gradient Sampling Max-Weight algorithm (GSMW), based on the ideas of gradient estimation and Max-Weight scheduling, that achieves sublinear utility regret. We further demonstrate the applicability of the gradient sampling approach to minimum delay routing in wireless networks. Finally, we consider the general problem of reinforcement learning for queueing networks with unbounded state-spaces, with the goal of making control decisions that minimizing the queue length. We formulate the problem as an MDP, and propose a new reinforcement learning framework, called Truncated Upper Confidence Reinforcement Learning (TUCRL), that can achieve optimal performance.  We show how this framework can be applied to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for online stochastic network optimization. </p>

     <p><b>Abstract:</b> Many network control problems (e.g., for minimizing age-of-information or latency) can be cast as Markov Decision Processes (MDP). However, as the network size increases, MDP is known to suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality. Index policies, e.g., the Whittle index, can be a useful tool to decompose an otherwise intractable multi-agent MDP into per-agent problems, which can then lead to low-complexity, scalable and highly adaptive solutions. However, the existing theory of Whittle index still has severe limitations. For one, when the problem of interest is slightly more complex, even verifying Whittle indexability becomes very challenging. For systems with multiple heterogeneous resources, while recent work has generalized Whittle index to partial index, verifying partial indexability is even more difficult. In this talk, we will introduce some recent work that develops easier-to-verify conditions for Whittle indexability and partial indexability. Our goal is to make index policies more easily applicable to a larger class of problem settings. We conclude with some discussions on other challenges and potential opportunities for index policies. </p>
